# Overview:
- five biomes (distinguished by color): water, sand, grass (green and burnt sienna), rock, and snow
- uses gain and bias to transition between biomes
- uses an impulse function to set height threshold according to time. This is the feature noted in the gui as "global warming"
- uses a power curve function to transition between normal (green) and hot (burnt sienna) global temperatures
- features Blinn Phong shading on oceans
- features Lambertian shading everywhere else
- gui contains controls to modify colors of biomes, speed of planet and moon animation, and global warming speed (how fast terrain moves above/below water).
- features a moon that orbits the planet.
- Worley noise and fbm noise are combined to create terrain texture on planet
- fbm noise used on moon

# Project Description:


## CIS 566 Project 1: Noisy Planets

## Objective
- Continue practicing WebGL and Typescript
- Experiment with noise functions to procedurally generate the surface of a planet
- Review surface reflection models

## Base Code
You'll be using the same base code as in homework 0.

## Assignment Details
- Update the basic scene from your homework 0 implementation so that it renders
an icosphere once again. We recommend increasing the icosphere's subdivision
level to 6 so you have more vertices with which to work.
- Write a new GLSL shader program that incorporates various noise functions and
noise function permutations to offset the vertices on the surface of the icosphere and modify the color of the icosphere so that it looks like a planet with geographic
features. Your planet should have __at least four distinct "biomes"__ on its surface (they do not have to be Earth biomes). Try making formations like mountain ranges, oceans, rivers, lakes, canyons, volcanoes, ice caps, glaciers, or even forests. We recommend using 3D noise functions whenever possible so that you don't have UV distortion, though that effect may be desirable if you're trying to make the poles of your planet stand out more.
- Combined with your noise functions, use __at least four__ different functions from the Toolbox Functions slides. They should be used to either adjust your noise distribution, or animate elements on your planet's surface.
- Implement __at least two__ surface reflection model (e.g. Lambertian, Blinn-Phong,
Matcap/Lit Sphere, Raytraced Specular Reflection) besides on the planet's surface to
better distinguish the different formations (and perhaps even biomes) on the
surface of your planet. Make sure your planet has a "day" side and a "night"
side; you could even place small illuminated areas on the night side to
represent cities lit up at night.
- Add GUI elements via dat.GUI that allow the user to modify different
attributes of your planet. This can be as simple as changing the relative
location of the sun to as complex as redistributing biomes based on overall
planet temperature. You should have __at least three modifiable attributes__.
- Have fun experimenting with different features on your planet. If you want,
you can even try making multiple planets! Your score on this assignment is in
part dependent on how interesting you make your planet, so try to
experiment with as much as you can!

## Submission
Commit and push to Github, then __make a pull request on the original Github repository__. Assignments will no longer be submitted on Canvas.

For this assignment, and for all future assignments, modify this README file
so that it contains the following information:
- Your name and PennKey
- Citation of any external resources you found helpful when implementing this
assignment.
- A link to your live github.io demo
- At least one screenshot of your planet
- An explanation of the techniques you used to generate your planet features.
Please be as detailed as you can; not only will this help you explain your work
to recruiters, but it helps us understand your project when we grade it!

## Extra Credit
Any or All of the following bonus items:
- Use a 4D noise function to modify the terrain over time, where time is the
fourth dimension that is updated each frame. A 3D function will work, too, but
the change in noise will look more "directional" than if you use 4D.
- Use music to animate aspects of your planet's terrain (e.g. mountain height,
  brightness of emissive areas, water levels, etc.)
- Create a background for your planet using a raytraced sky box that includes
things like the sun, stars, or even nebulae.
- Add a textured moon that orbits your planet
